Here are key strengths and weaknesses tailored specifically to your profile as a Full Stack AI Engineer — these are grounded in your actual resume so they sound authentic, not generic.

💪 Strengths
1. Full Stack + AI Hybrid Skill Set
"I bridge the gap between AI/ML and production engineering. I don't just build models — I integrate them into real, scalable applications using React, Node.js, FastAPI, and cloud infrastructure. That end-to-end ownership is something I genuinely enjoy."
2. Strong Problem-Solving with Measurable Impact
"I have a pattern of diagnosing root causes rather than patching symptoms — whether that's a 40% database load reduction through schema optimization or a 30% latency improvement through query caching. I tend to think in systems."
3. Rapid Tech Adoption
"The AI landscape moves fast. I've gone from building traditional full stack systems to integrating LLMs, RAG pipelines, and vector databases like Pinecone. I learn by building, so I pick up new tools quickly in a production context."

Weaknesses 
1. Perfectionism on Code Quality
"I sometimes spend more time than necessary refactoring code to make it cleaner before shipping. I've been working on balancing 'good enough to ship' with 'production-grade quality' by setting clearer personal timelines per task."
2. Formal ML Theory
"My ML experience is applied — I've used Scikit-learn, LLMs, and Isolation Forest in real projects, but my theoretical depth in areas like advanced neural architectures is still growing. I'm actively working through DeepLearning.AI courses to close that gap."
3. Public Speaking / Presentations
"I'm stronger in 1:1 technical discussions than large group presentations. I've been volunteering to present sprint demos and project walkthroughs to get more comfortable with it."
4. Saying No to Scope
"Early in my career I'd take on additional feature requests mid-sprint without pushing back. I've since learned to flag scope creep early and have structured conversations about trade-offs with the team."
